Requirements

Generating Anki Cards
=====================

1. Call: 

.. code-block:: python

    anki-vim DECKNAME

2. vim starts with a preformatted card.
   Start typing the front part of the anki card below "QUESTION", then fill out 
   the back below "ANSWER". 
   (*NOTE*: It is important to leave the QUESTION and ANSWER headers intact throughout)

3. save the file and exit the editor. (vim: ":wq") => the card contents are saved to: 
   `$HOME/.ankivim/decks/DECKNAME/raw_cards.txt`.
   (alternatively, you can specify a custom location for your decks using 
   the `--deckpath` option of `script/anki-vim.py`.)

4. editor starts right back up to generate a new card for the same deck => Iterate 2.-4. until all cards are generated.

5. to stop the card creation process, simply close your editor ( for vim: ":q" or ":q!", for additional information see
   `this book <https://www.amazon.com/How-Exit-Vim-Chris-Worfolk-ebook/dp/B01N5M1U6W>`_)
